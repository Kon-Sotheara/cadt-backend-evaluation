# Exercise 03 : Create

## Answer

## Question 01
**Why do we listen for data and end events when handling POST?**

In Node.js, POST data doesn’t arrive in a single block—it comes in chunks. So we use
the data event to gather those chunks as they arrive. Once all the data has been received,
the end event is triggered. That’s when we know the full body is ready, and we can safely
parse or use it. Without listening to both events, we might miss some data or process it
too early.

## Question 02
**What would happen if we didn’t buffer the body correctly?**

If we don’t properly collect and combine the chunks of data from the POST request, we
could end up with incomplete, broken, or incorrect data. This could cause issues like
storing only part of someone’s name, failing to parse the form, or even crashing the app if
the expected format isn’t matched. It’s like trying to read a message before the sender
finishes typing.

## Question 03
**What is the format of form submissions when using the default browser form POST?**

When you use a regular HTML <form> with method="POST", the browser sends the
form data in a format called application/x-www-form-urlencoded by default. This means
all form fields are encoded into a string format, like name=Sotheara, which looks like
query parameters but in the request body instead of the URL.

## Question 04
**Why do we use fs.appendFile instead of fs.writeFile?**

We use fs.appendFile because it adds new data to the end of the file without deleting
what's already there. If we used fs.writeFile, it would overwrite the file each time a new
form is submitted, and we’d lose the previous submissions. With appendFile, we can
keep a growing list of all form entries.

## Question 05
**How could this be improved or made more secure?**

To improve and secure this code, we could first validate the form input to prevent empty
or malicious data. Then, instead of saving to a plain text file, we could store the data in a
database like MongoDB or MySQL, which is safer and more structured. Also, using
HTTPS would encrypt the form data during transmission. Lastly, limiting request size
and sanitizing inputs helps protect against attacks like injection or denial of service.
