# Exercise 02: Manipulate

## Answer

## Question 01  
**What happens when you visit a URL that doesn’t match any of the three defined?**  

If we visit a URL that doesn’t match any of the defined routes like `/about`, `/contact-us`, `/products`, or `/projects`, the code in the final `else` block runs. This means the server will respond with **404 Not Found**.

## Question 02  
**Why do we check both the `req.url` and `req.method`?**  

We check both `req.url` and `req.method` because the **same URL can be used with different HTTP methods** for different purposes. For example:

- `GET /products` → Show the product list  
- `POST /products` → Add a new product (if implemented)

This approach allows more flexible and RESTful handling of routes.

## Question 03  
**What MIME type (`Content-Type`) do you set when returning HTML instead of plain text?**  

When returning HTML from the server, we need to tell the browser that the response
should be treated as an HTML document. This is done by setting the Content-Type
header to "text/html". In your code, this is done using res.writeHead(200, {
'Content-Type': 'text/html' });. If we don’t set this header, the browser might not render
the HTML properly and instead show it as plain text. On the other hand, when we send a
simple text message like a 404 error, we use "text/plain" to indicate it’s just regular text,
not HTML.

## Question 04
**How might this routing logic become harder to manage as routes grow?**

Right now, it’s okay with 5 routes. But as we add more routes, the code will:

- Get longer and harder to read
- Be difficult to update or debug
- Repeat similar patterns over and over
- It Is hard to organize logic for POST, PUT, etc.

Eventually, this if-else chain becomes a big mess especially for large applications.

## Question 05
**What benefits might a framework offer to simplify this logic?**

As your application grows and you add more routes and logic, using plain Node.js with
lots of if-else statements becomes difficult to manage. A framework like Express.js helps
simplify everything. It allows you to define routes in a cleaner and more organized way
using methods like app.get() or app.post(). This makes the code shorter, easier to read,
and easier to maintain. Express also provides useful features like automatic handling of
404 errors, built-in support for request data, routing parameters, and middleware that can
help with logging, authentication, and more. Overall, it saves time and reduces the chance
of making mistakes in routing logic.
